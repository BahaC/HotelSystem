To try it on local host, you need apache and SQL server,
when both of them are available in your computer and runned,
search for localhost/phpmyadmin from your browser to reach to the phpMyAdmin panel.
Then you need to create a new database with optional name and import sql file added to this repo.
So you have your database created. As a last step, you need to copy all the files inside of htdocs added to this repo
(css, php etc.) to xampp/htdocs directory in your computer after you clear inside of directory. 
Now you can reach hotel system from localhost/index.php from your browser
